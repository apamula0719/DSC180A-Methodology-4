**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
A potential investigation I'd like to pursue for the Quarter 2 Project is deploying an application to automatically detect anomalies in real time for ALERTCalifornia cameras.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
One thing I would change is training the model on fewer batches initially, since that slowed down our progress.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
Other techniques I would be interested in using would be using an unsupervised training method instead of having to label many images.
